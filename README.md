Larger Font Sizes for Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition
=======

Simply scales the font up on the font files directly. Works as an override, so achievements should stay enabled.

# To Install:
1. [Download a release]().
2. Extract the archive somewhere you prefer, then copy and paste the `Public` folder into your game's Data folder, i.e. `Steam\steamapps\common\Divinity Original Sin 2\DefEd\Data\`
3. The final result will look like this: ![Final Result](https://i.imgur.com/NksC28l.png "The location of the mod files.")

# Notes:
* This works by scaling the font ttf files themselves, so the upper limit of how high you can scale the fonts are somewhat limited.
* As DOS2 wasn't designed with these higher font sizes, certain UI elements may be broken if you go with a higher scaling size (10% seems fine initially).
* Since this "mod" is technically just overriding base game files, it doesn't count as an actual mod, and achievements will stay enabled if you're playing through with no mods.

# Current Scaling Options
* 110% - Most compatible.
* 115% - Seems fine initially.
* 120% - May have some issues with certain parts of the UI.
