Increased Font Sizes for Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition
=======

A guide for scaling the size of DOS2DE's font directly with the font files. Works as an override, so achievements should stay enabled.

# Frequently Asked Questions
## "How high can the scaling go?"
* Since font sizes are being scaled within the font file itself, anything too high may break the UI in certain ways. 200% in particular looks bad:

## "Why is this a guide, and not a release?"
* The fonts used in DOS2 all appear to be copyrighted (and quite expensive), so unfortunately re-distributing them is a no-no. Sorry!
