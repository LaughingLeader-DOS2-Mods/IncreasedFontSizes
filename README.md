Increased Font Sizes for Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition
=======

Simply scales the size of the font directly in the font files. Works as an override, so achievements should stay enabled.

# Notes:
* This works by scaling the font ttf files themselves, so the upper limit of how high you can scale the fonts are somewhat limited.
* As DOS2 wasn't designed with these higher font sizes, certain UI elements may be broken if you go with a higher scaling size (10% seems fine initially).
* Since this "mod" is technically just overriding base game files, it doesn't count as an actual mod, and achievements will stay enabled if you're playing through with no mods.

# Current Scaling Options
* 110% - Most compatibleo of the 3.
* 115% - Seems fine initially.
* 120% - Looks a bit like the font was made bold.

# Frequently Asked Questions
"Can I get a font scaling size of ___%?"
* We can try! The thing is, since font sizes are being scaled within the font file itself, anything above the current sizes may break the UI in certain ways. 200% in particular looked bad:
